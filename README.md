# VR Boat Simulator

**VR Boat Simulator** allows you to utilize a lever to control the direction of a boat while visualizing a wind sail on the palm of your right hand.

## Lever

The lever is designed to control the direction of the boat. A couple of things I added were passing the boat itself (the Boat) to the lever. The idea was to use the lever to move the boat. Below is an image showing the lever settings:

I have created several settings to control the boat based on the rotation range.

## Boat

Additionally, I have added the following properties to the boat:

The properties include:
- Transform value
- Max lever angle
- Boat rotation speed

Unfortunately, I haven't achieved success with the current settings.
